## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @travi/hapi-react-router -S
```

## Usage

Include this plugin in the [manifest](https://github.com/hapijs/glue) of your
hapi application to direct all requests to `/html` to a server-side renderer
for your react-router routes. It is assumed that something
([not included](https://github.com/travi/hapi-html-request-router)) is in place
to direct all `text/html` requests to this `/html` route.

In addition, [redial](https://github.com/markdalgleish/redial) `fetch` hooks
will be triggered and rendering will wait for all related requests to complete.
This enables populating the data store based on the components that are mounted
for the current route.

:warning: [a regenerator runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-regenerator/)
is required since this package leverages async functions

### Example

```js
export default {
    connections: [{port: 8090}],
    registrations: [
        {plugin: '@travi/hapi-html-request-router'},
        {
            plugin: {
                register: '@travi/hapi-react-router',
                options: {
                    respond: (reply, {renderedContent}) => {
                        reply.view('layout', {renderedContent});
                    },
                    routes: (
                        <Route path="/" component={Wrap}>
                            <IndexRoute component={Index}/>
                            <Route path="/foo" component={Foo}/>
                            <Route path="/bar" component={Bar}/>
                            <Route path="*" component={NotFound}/>
                        </Route>
                    ),
                    Root: ({store, children}) => (
                        <Provider store={store}>
                            {children}
                        </Provider>
                    ),
                    configureStore: ({session}) => createStore(reducer, composeMiddlewares(session))
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Dependencies for you to provide

This plugin provides you the ability to customize a few steps of the process.
Default implementations are currently not provided, so these dependencies are
required.

* `respond`: a function that will that allows you to call `reply` on your own,
  allowing you to perform additional steps before the response
* `routes`: the definition of your react-router routes that this plugin should
  match the request url against
  * If you use a [catch-all route](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/c3cd9675bd8a31368f87da74ac588981cbd6eae7/upgrade-guides/v1.0.0.md#notfound-route)
    to display an appropriate message when the route does not match, it should
    have a `displayName` of `NotFound`. This will enable the status code to be
    passed to `respond` as `404`. Please note that the automatic mapping of the
    `name` property should not be relied on because it can be mangled during
    minification and, therefore, not match in production.
* `Root`: a react component that will wrap the mounted components that result
  from the matched route
* `store`: a data store that will be passed as a prop to the `<Root />` component
  so that your component can inject it into the context through a provider
  component.
